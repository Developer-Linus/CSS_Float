#### This exercise meant to float two divs. One to the left and one to the right. Inside each div, the image is set to the left by float so that paragraphs wrap around them. To remove the effect of float effect on footer, I had to use clear property with value both. This removes the effect of float for both divs.

# CSS Float
 - This property is used commonly for wrapping images around text.
 1. **float**: Used to wrap text around another element(image).
 2. **clear**: used to remove the effect of float if we do not want the element to wrap another element(image).
